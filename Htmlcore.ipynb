        "            Web Design is the field of Designing Website interfaces. It deals with the looks part of the website rather than the coding part. Designing how the interface will look is called User Interface(UI) Design and Designing the flow of the user on the website, how the user will navigate through the website, etc are a part of User Experience(UX) Design.

        "Responsive Web Design means designing a website that is compatible with every screen type. Responsive websites resize themselves depending on the screen size of the device. It automatically adjusts to fit the user’s screen whether it’s desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, etc. Websites also scale the content and the elements accordingly. The elements in an interface get enlarged or reduced according to the screen size of the device.\n",
        "What is Adaptive Web Design?\n",
        "Adaptive Web Design refers to designing different layouts of the website for different devices. Many different devices' screen size is taken into account and the a different layout is designed for each of them. It is different from Responsive Web design as in Responsive Web design the same website interface adjusts itself depending on the device's screen size but Adaptive design changes the complete layout for that specific screen size. Since different layouts and are created for different devices their User Experience might differ too. A different User Experience can be created for multiple devices.\n",

        "What is Accessibilty in Web Design?\n",
        "Accessibility in Web Design is designing websites that everyone, including people with disabilities, can easily use. People who have trouble seeing, hearing, moving, or understanding can still use and understand the website very well. Descriptions for Images are added so that special software can read them aloud. Providing captions or written versions for videos helps in making the website more understandable and accessible. Colors are chosen in way that all the content is clear for everyone. This kind of design follows rules like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to ensure that the website is friendly and useful for all kinds of people.\n",
